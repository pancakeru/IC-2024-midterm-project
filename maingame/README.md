In this setup, we created a flexible Enemy class to animate multiple types of enemies using different sprite sheets. Each enemy type has unique frame dimensions, number of frames, and scaling factors, allowing us to customize their appearance and behavior. By adjusting the Enemy class to accept parameters like frameWidth, frameHeight, cols, and scale, we can now easily add new enemies with different visual characteristics. In the setup() function, we instantiated two types of enemies—Goblin and Golem—each with its specific parameters, and positioned them randomly on the screen. This approach makes it easy to expand our game by adding diverse enemy types while maintaining a clean, adaptable code structure.
