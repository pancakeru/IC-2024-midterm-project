# UPDATE 1
## Movement Prototype

The movement is top down with screen scrolling. 

We have not chosen assets right now so Perlin Noise was used to create a random background with obstructions and color detection was used to detect these obstructions.

Currently, its a bit slow (atleast on my computer) so maybe storing each tile in a 2d array might make querying for color faster?

The black box the player spawns in is to reduce chances of being locked in  (still possible)
